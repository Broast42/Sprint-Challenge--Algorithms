#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^3) --n multiplies by itself three times therfore the while loop runs n^3 times.


b) O(n log(n)) -- the for loop will run n times O(n) and the while loop incriments j by 2 meaning it runs at half of n times O(log(n)) making the total O(n log(n)).


c) O(n) -- every time the function recurses its addig 2 to the return value in a liniar fashion meaning that the function will only be called n times or in this case bunnies times.
